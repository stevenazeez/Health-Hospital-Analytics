# Health-Hospital-Analytics

Aim: Predicting the length of stay assists hospitals to enhance treatment strategies in order to reduce length of stay and infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors.

Tools: Python, Google Colab

Models: Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning models (XGBoost and Naive Bayes)

Project Highligths:

Hospital admission data was analyzed to accurately predict the patient’s Length of Stay at the time of admit so that the hospitals can optimize resources and function better. Built 3 models in Python to predict the length of stay,

A supervised algorithm Naïve Bayes which was classifying with an accuracy of 34.55%.

An ensemble method XGBoost which was predicting with an accuracy of 43.05%.
